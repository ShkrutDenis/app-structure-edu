# Description

In this repo, you can see 4 folders named PracticeX. Each folder it's a separate exercise.
Inside each folder, you can find two folders: `Files` and `Project`.
Inside the folder `Files` you can find dummy files that describe some project.
Each file has name that contains info of purpose of this file (f.e. file `comment_db_repository` means this file contains structures related to the comment DB model).
Also inside some files exists short description of this file or some example of code.

# How to complete exercises

Each PracticeX is an isolated exercise.
You need to create an application structure under the folder `Project` that will contain all files from the folder `Files`.
Also, files should be renamed in cases if need after moving to the new place.
