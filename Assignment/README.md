# Description

You can see two folders: `Files` and `Project`.
Inside the folder `Files` you can find dummy files that describe some project.
Each file has name that contains info of purpose of this file (f.e. file `comment_db_repository` means this file contains structures and logic related to the comment DB model).
Also inside some files exists short description of this file or some example of code for better understanding.

# How to complete assignment

You need to create an application structure under the folder `Project` that will contain all files from the folder `Files`.
Also, files should be renamed, in cases if needed, after moving to the new place.
